Medical Insurance Cost Prediction – Data Science Project

Project Overview
This is a Data Science project that focuses on predicting medical insurance costs based on individual attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.

The objective of this project is to analyze the data, understand the key factors affecting insurance charges, and build a machine learning model that can predict medical costs accurately.

Problem Statement
Medical insurance charges vary widely depending on lifestyle and personal attributes. Manually estimating these costs is difficult. This project aims to:

Analyze important factors influencing medical insurance costs

Build a predictive model using data science techniques

Predict insurance charges for new individuals

Dataset Description

Dataset Name: Insurance Dataset

Target Variable: charges

Features:

age: Age of the individual
sex: Gender (male/female)
bmi: Body Mass Index
children: Number of dependents
smoker: Smoking status (yes/no)
region: Residential region

The dataset is publicly available and commonly used for data science practice.

Machine Learning Model

Model Used: Linear Regression
Reason: Suitable for predicting continuous numerical values

Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (R²) Score

The model provides reasonable prediction accuracy after preprocessing and feature engineering.


Results

Identified key factors affecting medical insurance charges
